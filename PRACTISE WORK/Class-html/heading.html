    <h2>Sahaja Yoga - Ancient Knowledge Of Our Roots</h2>
    <p>The time has come for all of you to get your self-realisation, by which your attention becomes enlightened, your health gets completely all right, your mental processes are sensible, but above all you stand in your present.</p>
    <blockquote>-- H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, 29.09.1994, Los Angeles, USA</blockquote>
    <p title="Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi">
        Kundalini is the desire of God. "Is not desire for God" - "is the desire of God itself." So it can be only awakened by that desire. It is the desire of God within you that is being blessed and the desire of God is the shakti. And the desire of God is that He loves you. His desire is to give you all His powers and all his loving capacity. This is His desire. It is placed within you and is dormant. So when it rises, His desire is fulfilled. And that is how you get your fulfillment. Unless and until you are God, you cannot command desire of God. But after realization He gives you, bestows His power that you can manoeuvre His desire. You can raise the kundalini in the people which is the desire of God. And you can make Him desire. That is the greatest one can achieve.
