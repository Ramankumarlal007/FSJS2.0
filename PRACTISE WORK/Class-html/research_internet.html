    <h1>Research paper on agriculture</h1>
    <p>Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy which plays the most decisive role in the
        socioeconomic development of the country. Indian agriculture is a miscellaneous and extensive
        sector involving a large number of actors. India has one of the largest and institutionally most
        complex agricultural research systems in the world. The agricultural research system in India
        includes some 27,500 scientists and more than one lakh supporting staff actively engaged in
        agricultural research, which makes it probably the largest research system in the world.
        Historically, the Indian agricultural research system is the zenith of a process which started in the
        19th century and which resulted in the establishment of the Imperial (now Indian) Council of
        Agricultural Research (ICAR) on the recommendation of a Royal Commission on Agriculture in
        1929. In the present research system, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) at the
        National level mainly aids, promotes and coordinates research and education activities in the
        country. The development of agricultural research system in India, ever since the colonial era till
        today, is being tried to trace in the paper. An attempt has been made to portray the role of Five
        Year Plans regarding investment, technology transfer and other aspects related to agricultural
        development in India. Although agriculture has been playing the most vital role in Indian
        economy, during the course of the study, it has been observed that not much emphasis has been
        given to the history of evolution of agricultural research in India.</p>
        <p title="Bhogpur Village: an agricultural island of excellence">Near the holy city of Haridwar, in Bhogpur village, a Sahaja yogi has been using the grace of Shri Mataji to continuously produce extraordinary agricultural output through simple Sahaja yoga methods. In fact, the whole village has adopted his methods and has become quite popular in surrounding areas for its high food grain productivity. The vegetable and cattle feed size and quality is also much higher than that in surrounding villages. The effects have also been extended by its initiator, Jagpal Singh, in dairy sector, as a result of which the quality and quantity of milk of the dairy has shown very high improvements. This has also resulted in the dairy being awarded for having Highest Purity and Quality in the whole district.  </p>
