Through the harmonization of individual with paramchaitanya, many Sahaja yogis associated with agriculture have shown, that it is possible to achieve:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Higher food production</li>
    <li>Better growth of plants</li>
    <li>Protection against natural calamities</li>
    <li>Improved quality of cattle feed</li>
    <li>Robust health of cattle</li>
    <li>Increased milk production</li>
</ul>
<p title="sahajayoga research paper">And all this has happened without any extra money being invested. Sahaja yoga, the gift of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi to this earth, is not only limited to the prosperity of the mankind but to living forms of all kinds.

    Research on benefits of Sahaja yoga in agriculture has been performed by Maharana Pratap Agriculture & Tech University, Udaipur. Senior research scientists have successfully proved that by using seeds invigorated through vibrations, usage of vibrated water for irrigation and other Sahaja yoga methods, the plant quality & food production has been much higher than the normal yield
    
    Extensive research is also being undertaken by co-operative milk producers and the university to explore the possibility of utilizing the benefits of Sahaja yoga, for increasing milk production.</p>
